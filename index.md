Google Optimization Tools (a.k.a., OR-Tools) is an open-source, fast and portable software suite for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Google OR tools are essentially one of the most powerful tools introduced in the world of problem-solving.

The suite contains:

   1. A Linear Programming solver
   2. A Constraint Programming Solver
   3. Wrappers around commercial and other open source solvers, including mixed integer solvers
   4. Bin Packing and Knapsack Algorithms
   5. Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem
   6. Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum assignment).

## Installation


The fastest way to get OR-Tools is to install the Python binary version. If you already have Python (version 3.5+ on Linux, or 3.6+ on Mac OS or Windows), and the Python package manager PIP, you can install OR-Tools as follows: 

```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
```

Now, lets begin üëç

<b>Optimization</b>, essentially, means finding the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions. We all have finite resources and time & we want to make most of them. Either it is the task of scheduling the order at which you will answer the emails or switching to a new route back home to minimize traffic woes, we surely know how important optimization is to data science. One of the main concerns of a data scientist is creating a model that fits the problem like finding optimal heuristics, minimum function losses, etc. Therefore it is crucial to understand optimization frameworks.

Here in this article we will focus on understanding how to use OR-tools for linear and constraint optimization.

## Linear Optimization

Linear optimization (or linear programming) is the name given to computing the best solution to a problem modeled as a set of linear relationships. These problems arise in many scientific and engineering disciplines. (The word "programming" is a bit of a misnomer, similar to how "computer" once meant "a person who computes." Here, "programming" refers to the arrangement of a plan, rather than programming in a computer language.)

A real-world example can be the problem faced with FedEx delivery. The delivery person will calculate different routes for going to all the 6 destinations and then come up with the shortest route.

The primary OR-Tools linear optimization solver is <b>Glop</b>, Google‚Äôs linear programming system. It‚Äôs fast, memory efficient, and numerically stable. To learn how to use Glop to solve a simple linear problem in all of the supported languages, see <a href='https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/glop'>GLOP solver</a>

#### Using Glop in Python
To use Glop in Python:

Declare the solver using the Python wrapper pywraplp.
```python
from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp
def main():
  # Instantiate a Glop solver, naming it LinearExample.
  solver = pywraplp.Solver('LinearExample',
                           pywraplp.Solver.GLOP_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING)
```
Call the solver
```python
solver.Solve()
```

## Constraint Optimization
<b>Constraint optimization</b> or constraint programming (CP), is the name given to identifying feasible solutions out of a very large set of candidates, where the problem can be modeled in terms of arbitrary constraints. 

CP is based on feasibility (finding a feasible solution) rather than optimization (finding an optimal solution) and focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function. In fact, a CP problem may not even have an objective function ‚Äî the goal may simply be to narrow down a vary large set of possible solutions to a more manageable subset by adding constraints to the problem.

The most popular problem in constraint optimization is  <b>Employee Scheduling</b> and also happens to be our use case.

Like Morpheus in Matrix was in persuit of the <b>One</b> (Nemo) his whole life , we at BOX8 too are in continious persuit to deliver orders quickly and efficiently to our customers. To do so we have an army of delivery boys , 
but now the question is how to distribute them in all our outlets ? 
also how do we distribute them throught the day? 

To understand the complexity of the whole problem lets list what we would like to achieve:

1. More Delivery Boys during Peak Hours (if possible more skilled ones).
2. Sufficient Breaks between continious shifts.
3. More shifts to skilled Deilvery Boys 
4. Identifying which outlets need more Delivery Boys and which ones could do with less.
5. Minimum number of Delivery Boys to be always present in the outlet.

The above mentioned are just a few constraints we would like to put during roster generation, but doing so manually for the 100s of Delivery Boys in over 140+ outlets is pretty much impossible. This happens to be a perfect use case of OR-tools Constraint Optimzation Solver <b>CP-SAT</b>.

Check out the <a href='https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/employee_scheduling'>Nurse Scheduling Problem</a> to get a rudimentary understanding of employee scheduling and CP-SAT.

Now you have some idea of (N,D,S) problem . Now lets try to create our own constraint using OR-Tools

```python
self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
    for n in self.all_employees:
        for d in self.all_days:
            for s in self.all_shifts:
                self.shifts[(n, d,
                        s)] = self.model.NewBoolVar('shift_n%id%is%i' % (n, d, s))

def shift_constraint(self):
        #more than one employee on a particular day and a particular shift
        for d in self.all_days:
            for s in self.all_shifts:
                    self.model.Add(sum(self.shifts[(n, d, s)] for n in self.all_employees) > 1)
```
Before we design a constraint we need an OR-Tools variable to operate on.
In the first block of the code we are defining an OR-Tools Boolvar shifts[(n,d,s)] where:

1. n -> employee number(0...N)
2. d -> days number(0...D)
3. s -> shift number(0...S)

For example: Lets say we want employee 1 on day 1 to do shift 2 => shift[(0,0,1)] = 1

In the second block we are designing a basic shift constraint which states that for each shift there should be more than 1 employee(Delivery Boy).So the mathematical equation for that will be:

This mathematical equation when written programtically in python is something like - 
```python
    sum(self.shifts[(n, d, s)] for n in self.all_employees) > 1
```
Congrats you successfully created your first OR-Tools Constraint ! üëè
